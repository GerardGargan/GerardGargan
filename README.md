### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Gerard, im currently studying a part-time MSc in Software Development at Queens University Belfast, while working full time in a Senior Management position in a large manufacturing company.

I have just finished first year of my MSc where i gained a lot of experience programming in Java and learnt about the foundations of computer science.
Moving into second year, I will be diving into databases, SQL, web development and software engineering.

During the summer break I have been completing the Odin Project foundations course to prepare for the second semester content at QUB.
I have completed several projects and have been learning HTML, CSS and Javascript.
I am currently reading reading the book "Code" and experimenting with 3D printing after purchasing a Creality Ender 3 Neo V2.
I have also been interested in Data Structures and algorithms, I have watched most of the M.I.T online lectures on youtube and I a currently watching Harvards CS50 intoduction to computer science course.

Outside of this, I have a lot of experience in developing Power BI reports in my current job which are used globally in my organisation. I have recently completed Microsoft Power Platform training and I am helping my organisation to develop some low-code applications for business use cases.

Outside of work and coding, I like to spend time with my wide & dogs (Lola the springer, and Alfie the daschund).
I enjoy running and partake in my local parkrun on a saturday morning, and some additional runs during some evenings after work.
I have a passion for learning and enjoy solving problems.

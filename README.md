### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Gerard. I'm currently in my second year of a MSc in Software Development at Queens University Belfast (Part-time).

I'm currently working on a web app for the MSc Web Development module. The app will be built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js and Express.
The app will allow users to sign up, login and record emotive snapshots, including any triggers. It will incorporate some Dashboards and visualisations/graphs by using Graph.js. For a bit of fun, it will be themed around my favorite christmas movie! Since it was started around that time..

I'm currently working on improving my problem solving skills and how to approach this programmatically. I'm working through leetcode and codesignal exercises.
In my spare time im also completing the Odin Projects Full Stack Javascript course (I completed the foundations course over the summer).

I'm currently looking to get more and more practice building out web apps and java applications.
